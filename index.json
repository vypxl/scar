I mainly create it for my own games, for my own education\nand of course for the fun.\n\n## Features\n\n- Event system\n- Configurable input handling\n- Universal 2D Vector class\n- Entity-Component-System architecture\n- Configuration manager\n- Asset manager with hot-reloading\n- Inbetweening\n- [Tiled](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled) map support\n- Some builtin components and systems\n\n## Planned Features\n\n- Sound manager\n- Video playback\n\n## Examples\n\nYou can find examples in the [examples](https://github.com/vypxl/scar/tree/main/examples) directory.\nTo run an example, execute the following command in your terminal, while in the root directory of this repo:\n\n```bash\ncrystal run examples/<example-name>/main.cr\n\n# e. g.\ncrystal run examples/hello_world/main.cr\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this to your application's `shard.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  scar:\n    github: vypxl/scar\n    branch: main\n```\n\nIf you run into build/linking problems, please check if you have SFML installed properly, as described in the\n[CrSFML Guide](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml/blob/master/README.md#Installation). You **do not** need to add\nCrSFML as a dependency!\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests are welcome, just open an issue!\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Create an [Feature Request] Issue\n2. Fork it ( https://github.com/vypxl/scar/fork )\n3. (optional) Create the git hook checks via `$ scripts/create-git-hooks`\n4. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)\n5. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')\n6. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)\n7. Create a new Pull Request and mention your issue\n\nYou have to ensure that `crystal spec` and `crystal tool format --check ./src ./spec` return 0.\n\n## Contributors\n\n-

module provides a convenient interface for loading different kinds of assets\nUsage:\n1. `#use` a folder or zip file to index their contents\n2. (optional) Use `#cache` (or `#cache_zipfile`) to preload assets into memory without instatiating the respective asset types\n3. `#load` (or `#load_all`) the assets you want to use in your application\n4. Use `#[]` or the more specific methods like `#text` to retrieve the loaded instances of your assets\n\nLoading the assets should be done in bulk at the start of the application or while a loading screen is shown,\nso that there are no mid-gameplay slowdowns\n\n### Music and Sound\n\nMusic and sound are somewhat special kinds of assets. It is recommended to use the `Music`\nand the `Sound` (coming soon) module to handle them. See the respective documentation for details.\n\n### Hot reloading\n\nThe `Assets` module supports hot reloading of certain asset types.\n\nThe asset types that are reloaded automatically are: `Texture`, `Sound`, `Music`, `Font`\n\n`Components::Tilemap` components can also automatically reload their data if you use their `String` constructor (`Components::Tilemap#new(String)`)\n\nYou can specify a block when retrieving assets, this block will get called\nwhen a change is detected. This works for all asset types.\n\nTo enable hot-reloading, set `App#hotreload` to `true`.\nHot-reloading only works if you are loading assets from plain files (not zipped) without caching them.\n\n### Exampe usage:\n```\nScar::Assets.use \"./assets\"\nScar::Assets.load \"textures/player.png\"\n\ntex = Scar::Assets.texture(\"textures/player.png\") { |new_tex| puts \"Player texture was modified\" }\nplayerSprite = Scar::Components::Sprite.new tex\n```","summary":"<p>This module provides a convenient interface for loading different kinds of assets Usage: 1.</p>","class_methods":[{"html_id":"default_font:Font?-class-method","name":"default_font","doc":"If you set this property, `Components::Text` components can be created without specifying a font.

component is a more advanced wrapper around `SF::Sprite`.\n\nIt supports multi-state animation based on a spritesheet. It is supposed to be used in conjunction with `Systems::AnimateSprites`.\n\nThe spritesheet must such a layout that each animation state can be described as an index range\ninside the spritesheet. This means that each frame must have the same pixel size and all frames\nof an animation state must appear in sequence in the spritesheet (right-down order).\nSee [Scar examples](https://github.com/vypxl/scar_examples) for real-world examples.\n\nExample usage:\n```\n# The example spritesheet could be lay out like this:\n#\n# AAAABB\n# BBCCCC\n#\nsprite = Scar::Components::AnimatedSprite.new(\n  Assets.texture(\"textures/spritesheet.png\"), # Get the spritesheet from the asset manager\n  {32, 32},                                   # Each frame has a size of 32x32 pixels\n  {\n  \"A\" => {0, 4, 2}, # Start index: 0, framecount: 4, fps: 2\n  \"B\" => {4, 4, 5}, # Start index: 4, framecount: 4, fps: 5\n  \"C\" => {8, 4, 8}, # Start index: 8, framecount: 4, fps: 8\n}\n)\n\nsprite.state = \"A\" # Necessary, there is no default animation state\n```\n\nIf you specify `0` fps, the animation will not advance by itself. It can be advanced manually by calling `#next`.\n\nNote that animation states can share frames, but only if both states' frames remain in sequence.\n\nExample:\n> Spritesheet layout: `AASSBB`.\n\n> Animation states `A` and `B` share the frames `S` in the middle.\n\n> State `A` uses the frames 0-3 and state `B` uses the frames 2-5.","summary":"<p>This component is a more advanced wrapper around
